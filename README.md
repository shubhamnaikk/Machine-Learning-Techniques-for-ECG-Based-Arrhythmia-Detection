# Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-ECG-Based-Arrhythmia-Detection


Developed a machine learning model to classify arrhythmias from a dataset of 452 examples, achieving 80.21%
accuracy with Kernelized SVM.
Implemented PCA for dimensionality reduction, enhancing model performance and addressing high-dimensional
data challenges.
Evaluated and tuned various algorithms, including KNN and Logistic Regression, to optimize accuracy and recall
in arrhythmia detection.
